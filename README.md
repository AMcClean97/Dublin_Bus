## Project Specification:
Bus companies produce schedules which contain generic travel times. For example, in the Dublin Bus Schedule,  the  estimated  travel  time  from  Dun  Laoghaire  to  the  Phoenix  Park  is  61 minutes (http://dublinbus.ie/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/46a-1/).  Of  course,  there  are  many variables  which  determine  how  long  the  actual  journey  will  take.  Traffic  conditions  which  are affected  by  the  time  of  day, the day of  the  week, the month of  the year  and  the  weather  play  an important role in determining how long the journey will take. These factors along with the dynamic nature of the events on the road network make it difficult to efficiently plan trips on public transport modes which interact with other traffic.

## The Solution:
This project involves analysing historic Dublin Bus data and weather data in order to create dynamic travel  time  estimates.  Based  on  data analysis of  historic  Dublin  Bus data,  a  system  which  when presented  with  any  bus  route,  departure  time, the day of  the  week,  current  weather  condition, produces an accurate estimate of travel time for the complete route and sections of the route. Users  should  be  able  to  interact  with  the  system  via  a  web-based  interface  which is optimised  for mobile devices. When presented with any bus route, an origin stop and a destination stop, a time, a day  of  the  week,  current  weather,  the system  should  produce and  display  via  the  interface  an accurate estimate of travel time for the selected journey.
